## Image-dependent topics

Some Stage 1 resources rely on pictorial data that we have not recreated yet. Track them here so we can prioritise follow-up work.

| Stage | Topic | Reason we skipped it | Source asset |
|-------|-------|----------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Pictograms | Requires bespoke pictogram visuals to interpret the data correctly; current UI only supports text-based questions. | `MathsGenie Stuff/Stage 1/1-pictograms.pdf` |

_Add to this list when you encounter other topics that can’t be represented accurately without custom images or charts._
